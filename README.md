# MY_portfolio
I learned HTML and CSS through the Error Makes Clever Academy, where I gained hands-on experience and built a solid foundation in web development. As part of my learning journey, I have created my first simple portfolio project using HTML and CSS, showcasing the skills Iâ€™ve developed and presenting my work in a clean, professional layout.
